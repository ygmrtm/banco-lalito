# ADR 001: Migration from DenoJS and TypeScript to NodeJS

**Date:** 2024-10-03

## Context:
Version 1.0.0 of "Banco Lalito" was built using DenoJS and TypeScript. After internal discussions, we considered migrating to NodeJS for version 2.0.0 to better align with future integrations and execution on platforms like Replit.

## Participants:
- **Ygmrtm** (Lead developer)
- **Luis** (Team lead)
- **Anna** (Backend expert)
- **Sophie** (Frontend developer)

## Discussion:
### Pros of staying with DenoJS/TypeScript:
- Strong type system (TypeScript)
- Built-in security features in DenoJS
- Native support for ES modules

### Cons of staying with DenoJS/TypeScript:
- Limited library support compared to NodeJS
- Smaller community and ecosystem
- Challenges in running Deno apps on Replit

### Pros of migrating to NodeJS:
- Extensive ecosystem and community support
- Easier integration with third-party services (Notion SDK, Spotify API, etc.)
- Easier deployment on platforms like Replit
- Smooth integration with tools like Docker and Postman

### Cons of migrating to NodeJS:
- Loss of native TypeScript support (although this can be reintroduced later)
- Slightly weaker security model compared to Deno

## Resolution:
We decided to migrate to NodeJS for version 2.0.0. The decision was mainly driven by the broader ecosystem and integration needs for future features (e.g., machine learning, MongoDB). Additionally, platform deployment considerations, like Replit, played a major role.

**Final decision:** Transition the backend to NodeJS for its stability, support, and ease of future integration. We'll revisit TypeScript integration in future updates.
